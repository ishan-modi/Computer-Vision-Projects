# OpenCV Projects

The repository contains starter projects for Computer Vision. It includes working with images, live video feeds and using Deep Learning models in coordination with computer vision.

 The project includes classification of clothing items into 10-classes as shown above. A deep neural network is used for the classification. The model summary is as follows.

The results obtained on the model were pretty good with an accuracy of over 90 percent.

## Finger Count

The projects involves working with a video feed and detecting various fingers in hand using contour detection algorithms. The user needs to place hand in ROI (region of interest) that is a red box on the screen. The program will count the number of fingers that are erect. Some of the outcomes of project are shown below.

## Interactive Video

The project involves making various shapes on video feed by mouse clicks. In this case with every click a new circle is made with center at point of click. This ensures active interaction with video. The demonstration of outcomes is as follows.

## Liscence Plate Detection and Blur

This project demonstrates the use of haarcascade-classifiers for object detection and use of kernel for blurring the ROI. Often we want to blur face of person, personal details etc. This is one such use case.
